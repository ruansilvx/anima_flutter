# Anima Flutter (WIP)

A simple playground flutter app that consumes the [anima api](https://github.com/ruansilvx/anima-api).

**Disclaimer:** The api is correctly called only for android emulators. You may make it work on another platform/device by changing the base url at [dio_module.dart](lib/src/dio_module.dart).

## TODO

- [x] Improve all modules' README
- [ ] Add string internationalization
- [ ] Add favorite feature using local storage (probably Hive)
- [ ] Add some sort of authentication
- [ ] Improve overall design and UX
- [ ] Improve app to also properly support Web and iOS
- [ ] Think of what to do next
